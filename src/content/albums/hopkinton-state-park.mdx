intro: Penuche and I have spent many mornings this winter at Hopkinton State Park --most days we're the only ones there. This was a particularly cold day following a snowstorm, so the silence and emptiness stood out. Admist the noise of every day life, it's nice to have a quiet place to go and just be.
